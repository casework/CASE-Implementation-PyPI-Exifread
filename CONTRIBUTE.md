# Contributing to CASE-Implementation-PyPI-Exifread

This repository follows the ["Git-flow" branching model](https://cyberdomainontology.org/ontology/development/#branching-cdo-git-flow).  In short, this means:

* For new features, revisions, and bugfixes, please branch off of `develop` and file pull requests against `develop`, rather than branching from and targeting `main`.
